# MoWApEx
A modular web application that controls the experiment

The project aims to create an application that allows you to collect data from specialized measuring devices, e.g.
PhysioGrad (Physiolution GmbH), which is used to measure the temperature and pH of solutions and allows control of the valve assembly. The application should be optimized in terms of fast information processing and guarantee high availability, offer a web interface.
The application will be used in areas such as operation monitoring, collecting application metrics, sensor data, etc.
